 *
 * Database URL (CIVICRM_DSN) for CiviCRM Data:
 * Database URL format:
 *      define( 'CIVICRM_DSN', 'mysql://crm_db_username:crm_db_password@db_server/crm_database?new_link=true');
 *
 * See https://docs.civicrm.org/installation/en/latest/general/mysql_tls/#dsn-settings for how to append
 * ssl options to the Database URL.
 *
 * Drupal and CiviCRM can share the same database, or can be installed into separate databases.
 * Backdrop CMS and CiviCRM can also share the same database, or can be installed into separate databases.
 *
 * EXAMPLE: Drupal/Backdrop and CiviCRM running in the same database...
 *      DB Name = cms, DB User = cms
 *      define( 'CIVICRM_DSN'         , 'mysql://cms:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost/cms?new_link=true');
 *
 * EXAMPLE: Drupal/Backdrop and CiviCRM running in separate databases...
 *      CMS DB Name = cms, DB User = cms
 *      CiviCRM DB Name = civicrm, CiviCRM DB User = civicrm
 *      define( 'CIVICRM_DSN'         , 'mysql://civicrm:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost/civicrm?new_link=true');
 *
 * If your username, password, server or DB name contain a single quote or backslash, escape those characters
 * with a backslash: \' and \\, respectively.
