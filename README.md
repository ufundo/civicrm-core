# RiverLea CiviCRM Core Framework Theme

Theme architecture for CiviCRM that separates visual/UI CSS from structural CSS using CSS variables. It currently has two variations, or 'streams': Hoxton, based on Shoreditch, and Abingdon, based on Grenwich. Edit civicrm.css file to swap between them.

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).

## Changelog

0.1 - proof-of-concept, Brunswick, empty theme structure doing just two things: for older CMS interfaces enforces a 100% font-size default to cascade the browser default font-size, and demonstrates a 1rem variable on top of that for some Civi body text sizes. The computed font-size of Civi paragraph and table text should show as 16px in Inspector (for standard setups).
0.2 - adds a bunch of css variables for testing/dev, adds the entirity of the current Greenwich Bootstrap 3 build to start cutting it back, and adds a components directory with initial component 'accordions' (with animated exapnd/close + CSS variables). Separate components files will likely be merged when the extension is moving to testing, to reduce http requests.
0.3.alpha - RiverLea CiviCRM theme at ~ 80% (*"The last 20% of work takes the same amount of time as the previous 80%."). Has two 'streams' Hoxton and Abingdon.

- Uses colour variables so will not work on Internet Explorer (flag if this is an issue and fallbacks can be added)
- .Woff versions of fonts used as the smallest - but ttf and otf versions are included. To further improve speed, change font-family to 'inherit' to use the theme fonts (FontAwesome is still needed)
- Many sprites have been removed - animated gifs (loaders) are kept, as are a few sprites that are either hard to replace with FA (ie the select2 dropdown arrows), or whose use is unclear
- More testing is needed, issues welcome.

Version 0.1 
- is a quick merge of the default civicrm.css and civicrm-shelford.css. This means some sprite paths may be broken and there are duplicate selectors.
- use of CSS variables not supported by IE or < MS Edge 15.
- not tested on Wordpress, Backdrop or Drupal 8.
